To make eCalculate available for all users you have to place the following files in special directories.

* ecalculate.py in /opt/ecalculate/
* ecalculate.desktop in /usr/share/applications/
* ecalculate in /usr/local/bin/ 
* ecalculate.png in /usr/share/pixmaps/

After that you can access eCalculate either through shell with the command "ecalculate" or by using graphical tools like Everything.
